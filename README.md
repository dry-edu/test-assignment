# Assignment Title

## Description

In this assignment you will be looking at some starter code and explore reading input from the user.

### Relevant Standards

- ATP.VDR.9-12.F.a Identify types of variables and data and utilize them to create a computer program that stores data in appropriate ways.
- ATP.M.9-12.F.b Create computational artifacts by systematically organizing, manipulating and/or processing data.

## Tasks

1. Compile and run the starter code. Take notice of what it outputs.
2. Modify the code to use a `Scanner` Object to read user input into a `String`.
3. Modify the code to output the users input, instead of saying `Hello World!\n` every time.

Remember that you can create a new `Scanner` object using the following code:

```java
Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
```

For more information on how to use the `Scanner` object you can review the [relevant java documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html).

## Deliverables

- You should have a class called `App.java` that contains a `main` method.
- Your program should read input from the user, and output the same message back out to them.

### Example 1

Input

```md
Hello World!

```

Output

```md
Hello World!

```

### Example 2

Input

```md
Goodbye World!

```

Output

```md
Goodbye World!

```
